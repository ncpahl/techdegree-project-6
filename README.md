Project 6

Build a Game Show App

In this project, you'll create a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game. You’ll use Javascript to come up with a random phrase that players will try to guess by entering different letters into the program. Interactive image galleries are a common feature of many websites, from photo sites to e-commerce applications. Use HTML, CSS and the popular programming language JavaScript to create an interactive, searchable gallery of photos.
